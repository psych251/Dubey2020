Xi Jia Zhou's replication project for Psych251.

All code are in file /code; data are in file /data; and generated images are in file /images.
Within file code, original_analysis.m is the original code from the study. 
The main_analysis_code_adapted.m is what I adapted from the original code to fit my data structure for analysis.
(Remember to add cuntions to path when you run both code in MATLAB).
